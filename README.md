Games AI Techniques - Group 6
=============================


Deadlines
-------------
- 07/10/2012 - Submission: source code and report file.
- Presentation: might be the week after submission.


What should we do to improve our game
-------------
- Overlord system: spawn Wolves when they die, cache the Alpha Wolf (the one who catches the most Sheep or has the most success).
- The Overlord can learn and sgenerate interesting mazes each time it runs!?!?!
- Evolutionary learning: the Wolves know how to hunt. Increase or decrease their intensity overtime depends on their success.
- Pathfinding system: Decision tree to choose suitable path. Wolves work together to catch Sheep. Learn from previous mistakes to choose their decisions.
